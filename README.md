# Melanoma_detection
> we have detected melanoma. It is more dengerous if we have not detected. I solved this using the some neural network module. I had few images with diffrent types, I had trained the module using images and then we can detect the melanoma using images.

## General Information
- This projrct is related biomedical. 
- I used Tensorflow, Developed by the Google Brain team, TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework widely used for building neural network models. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for building and deploying machine learning applications.
- We can easily detect melanoma using images. No need to test many things for test.
- we used diffrent types of images for detecting diffrent types of Melanomma.

## Conclusions
- We have to find out good model for detedct skin scancer
- For bulid mode we reqire many samples foe accuracy 
- We have to check dropouts for accuracy as well
